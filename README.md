Objective of Exercise
¡ñ Skills:
¡ð Practice Agile SW Development techniques
¡ð Practice Code Management Tools (GitHub)
¡ñ Development:
¡ð Practice Cloud Services
¡ð Practice basic service APIs (e.g., login)
¡ð Practice Database basic skills
¡ð Simulate service. This is important:
¡ö Efficiency and productivity: So you can develop your SW with APIs while
your colleagues are working to complete their parts
¡ö System Design: Define expected behavior with unit tests to ensure
components can can be done independently with high quality.
¡ñ Verification:
¡ð Define tests to ensure that your deliverable meets the requirements.
Project Details
Build an application that is secure (requires logging in. This can be via gmail, facebook or your
own system), The application should basically received and plot sampled temperature and
humidity from a sensor. You don¡¯t have to develop the sensor but you are expected to simulate
it.
¡ñ The application can be iOS, Android or WEB application
¡ñ You can use any cloud service provider
¡ñ You can use any database including database services
Please note that you need to demonstrate that you can have multiple people accessing the app.
Moreover you can access multiple sources of temperature and humidity. Multiple temperature
or humidity sources can be associated with a user. Think of a user to be a homeowner while
the temperature source or humidity is for one room in her/his home.
